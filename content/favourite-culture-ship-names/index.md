As I mentioned before [I am re-reading the novels of Iain Banks](more-books) and this weekend I managed to finish _Consider Phlebas_. A little post about it will be coming up soon. One of my favourite things about the Culture novels is how the ships are named and having found [a list on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ships_(The_Culture)), I thought I would share ten of my favourites with you!
  
1. _You’ll Clean That Up Before You Leave_  
2. _Ravished By The Sheer Implausibility Of That Last Statement_  
3. _All Through With This Niceness And Negotiation Stuff_  
4. _Prosthetic Conscience_  
5. _Of Course I Still Love You_  
6. _Size Isn’t Everything_  
7. _Hand Me The Gun And Ask Me Again_  
8. _Dramatic Exit, Or, Thank you And Goodnight_  
9. _We Haven’t Met But You’re A Great Fan Of Mine_  
10. _Anticipation Of A New Lover’s Arrival, The_

Great names all I am sure you would agree. Not all of them appear as fully developed characters. In fact (and I will mention this again later) the ships don’t get nearly enough time as characters in the novels apart from _Excession_, which is almost entirely devoted to them. In that novel, one ship is central to the story and is probably my favourite, an eccentric GCU (General Contact Unit) called _Grey Area_ that has been shunned by the other machines for “non-consensual mind reading”. It turns out the ship is somewhat morbid and likes to confront the perpetrators of genocides with their crimes. It is known by the other ships as “the meatf***er” and is totally badass.
