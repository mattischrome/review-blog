*Finally* saw Guardians of the Galaxy today. Here are fifteen observations about the film that may or may not constitute a short review.

1. At least two Oscars for [Best Use Of Body Paint (Green)](http://media.comicbook.com/uploads1/2014/07/guardians-of-the-galaxy-gamora-101682-101718.jpg) and [Best Use Of Body Paint (Blue)](http://images.radiotimes.com/namedimage/Karen_Gillan_takes_on_Zoe_Saldana_in_extended_Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_trailer.jpg?quality=85&mode=crop&width=620&height=374&404=tv&url=/uploads/images/original/53103.jpg) are sewn up.
2. Chris Pratt basically plays Star Lord as “[Andy Dwyer](http://parksandrecreation.wikia.com/wiki/Andy_Dwyer) in space” and this is fine by me.
3. Best movie to feature [a talking raccoon](http://www.etonline.com/movies/148845_bradley_cooper_explains_his_voice_guardians_of_the_galaxy/) in a long time.
4. [Watching the entirety of the end credits of Thor 2](http://screenrant.com/thor-2-dark-world-mid-post-credits-button-scenes-explained) paid off!
5. “_WE_ are [Groot](https://uk.yahoo.com/movies/dancing-baby-groot-clip-guardians-of-the-galaxy-94738291414.html)” — aren’t we just?! All of the feels.
6. It features a dance off as a major event, something that it shares with the [Step Up movies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_Up_(film_series)). Guardians of the Galaxy is a waaaay better movie.
7. The first words of the credits are [“The Guardians of the Galaxy will return”](http://www.mtv.com/news/1887915/guardians-of-the-galaxy-sequel/). It is in fact a movie that reviews itself.
8. The 3D version might have been pretty good. I watched the 2D version but [the scenes with lots of action _might_ be improved with a bit of depth](http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Guardians-Galaxy-Has-Something-Special-Planned-Its-IMAX-3D-43350.html).
9. [A great soundtrack](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/11033572/Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Awesome-Mix-soundtrack-tops-Billboard-chart.html), but there is a cheesy “smooth rock wins chicks” bit that’s a little icky half way through.
10. That said, the description of the legend of [Footloose](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087277/) is hilarious. Especially the callback toward the end of the movie.
11. I especially enjoyed the scene with [the Collector](http://www.slashfilm.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-easter-eggs-quotes/).
12. Karen Gillen is wasted as Nebula, but [hopefully she will be back](http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Nebula-Return-Guardians-Galaxy-2-66648.html). Karen’s also in what may well be [one of the most ill-conceived TV shows of all time](http://abc.go.com/shows/selfie) later this autumn.
13. I thought it was Bruce Willis playing [Drax the Destroyer](http://whatculture.com/wwe/batista-praised-role-guardians-galaxy-movie.php) (I’m useless at this guess the actor game). I loved his taking things literally: “Nothing goes over my head. My reflexes are too fast, I would catch it.”
14. If you text me at any point in the next month, I will probably reply with [“I am Groot”](http://www.nerdist.com/2014/08/translate-any-website-into-groot-speak-with-this-nifty-new-button/).
15. No Raccoons or tree creatures were harmed during the making of this film.
