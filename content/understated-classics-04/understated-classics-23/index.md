It was quite hard to choose an 808 State album for the [understated classics series](understated-classics) for two reasons. The first is that I was introduced to 808 State quite late through a friend's sister's cassette copy of The Shamen's En-Tact (the original version recorded from vinyl that had a thirteen minute version of "Evil Is Eden") that also had -- to fill out the C90 -- the full length sweary version of "What Time Is Love?" by The KLF and four tracks: "Cubik", "Pacific", "Olympic" (I think...), and "In Yer Face".

That early introduction only served to flag up the name and in the days when you had to wait months between album purchases (on cassette!) I didn't really get any more 808 State until I bought "Lopez" from "Don Solaris" on _cassette single_ mainly because, if I recall correctly, I was mad on The Propellerheads at the time and wanted their remix. I soon came to prefer the languid original though, and eventually, in 1998 I bought the cassette version of their Greatest Hits (at the time) _808:88:98_. Happy days. An album so good that I tracked down a CD version on eBay a while later.

So reason number one is that my overall favourite 808 State album is that undoubtedly fan-polarising compilation, chiefly because it's hooked in to bobbing between home and college (a good hour's walk) believing that I was the only person of my peer group remotely interested in this music.

Reason number two is rather more prosaic. I now own five studio albums by 808 State and I really can't decide which I like best. I also have another compilation -- _Blueprint_, released a few years back -- and even that is interesting for its own reasons (but can't beat the heady A to B rush of _808:88:98_). In the end I've decided on 1993's _Gorgeous_ because it's the "one in the middle" and it happens to contain _Plan 9_, which is my all-time fave 808 State track.

I'll spare you a track-by-track trip through the track list but you should there's some good stuff on here, not least the aforementioned _Plan 9_ (a beautiful lilting guitar riff with an urgent but not over the top bass line), _One In Ten_ (the UB40 collab that references unemployment statistics that I instead collared as my own personal bisexual pride anthem), _10x10_ (the uplifting house anthem that will leave you smiling for days), _Moses_ (featuring Ian McCulloch in the Bernard Sumner role -- see _EX:EL_ for more details), and _Europa_ (a beautiful intro with bells and a bizarrely Stock, Aitken & Waterman spoofing female vocal). Oh and _Contrique_ samples _She's Lost Control_ by Joy Division!

My only issue with the album is a weird quirk of the sequencing. There are fifteen tracks and regular readers will know that I love a short album, so I'd prefer it if _Gorgeous_ ended with the moody drum-centred _Colony_ (a nice eleven tracks if you don't mind). Instead the remaining four tracks -- _Timebomb_, _Stormin' Norman_ (How nineties a reference is that!), _Sexy Dancer_, and _Sexy Synthesizer_ -- add pretty much another EP on to the end of the album. It doesn't help that _Stormin' Norman_ and _Sexy Dancer_ are actually awful. I quite like _Sexy Synthesizer_ though, it reminds me of _Last Train To Trancentral_ by The KLF and perhaps its pairing with _Sexy Dancer_ has some sort of "Revenge of the Nerds" thing going on.

Overall though, _Gorgeous_ is a pretty amazing sounding album that has aged well to my ears, only those last two tracks (and possibly the faux saxophone of _Black Morpheus_) sound vaguely nineties. The rest is finely honed and stylish modern dance music that you really should wrap your ears around some time.
