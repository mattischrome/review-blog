When your birthday brings the world under your window  
And the [song-thrush](http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/s/songthrush/index.aspx) sings wet-throated in the dew  
And [aconite](http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/plants/plant_finder/plant_pages/286.shtml) and [primrose](http://www.countrysideinfo.co.uk/primrose.htm) are unsticking the wrappers  
Of the package that has come today for you  
  
Lambs bounce out and stand astonished  
[Puss willow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pussy_willow) pushes among bare branches  
Sooty [hawthorns](http://www.british-trees.com/treeguide/hawthorns/nbnsys0000003430) shiver into emerald  
  
And a new air  
Nuzzles the sugary  
Buds of the [chestnut](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7549489.stm). A groundswell and a stir  
Billows the silvered  
Violet silks  
Of the south - a tenderness  
Lifting through all the  
Gently-breasted  
Counties of England.  
  
When the [swallow](http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/s/swallow/index.aspx) snips the string that holds the world in  
And the [ring-dove](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_Dove) claps and nearly loops the loop  
You just can't count everything that follows in a tumble  
Like a whole circus tumbling through a hoop  
  
Grass in a mesh of all flowers floundering  
Sizzling leaves and blossoms bombing  
Nestlings hissing and groggy-legged insects  
  
And the trees  
Stagger, they stronger  
Brace their [boles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bole_(botany)) and biceps under  
The load of gift. And the hills float  
Light as bubble glass  
On the smoke-blue evening  
  
And rabbits are bobbing everywhere, and a thrush  
Rings cooly in a far corner. A shiver of green  
Strokes the darkening slope as the land  
Begins her labour.  
  
**Ted Hughes** "April Birthday" (1976)
