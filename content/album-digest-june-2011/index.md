I have had the sort of month that is not conducive to listening to much new music. Therefore this month’s post is only going to consider two new albums and two albums that I have bought behind time. Because of various bits of stress and poor mood, I have ended up going back and taking refuge in some old favourites and not listening to new stuff. At other points I have also gone back to the Fleet Foxes’ album that I wrote about last month, which has grown on me even more since. Sometimes I think that I should writing about these albums on a two month delay. Meanwhile, I even have new music that I haven’t listened to _at all_, namely **Bon Iver**’s self-titled album. It has received so many good reviews that I have been too intimidated to listen to it. I will try to write about it next month.

Instead by way of brand new albums we have _Codes And Keys_ by **Death Cab For Cutie** and _Gloss Drop_ by **Battles**. Meanwhile on back order we have _Wounded Rhymes_ by **Lykke Li** and _These Re-imagined Machines_ by **BT**.

Starting with _Codes and Keys_, we have a nice album that is better than their last album _Narrow Stairs_ though the best tracks don’t  square up with the best ones on the previous album. There _Bixby Canyon Bridge_ had a sadness that turned to cynicism over five minutes in a spectacular way and there is nothing to match that here. Meanwhile _Narrow Stairs_’ other cracker _Long Division_ played out the highs from the previous Death Cab albums in a wonderfully catchy way, a task that falls to _Monday Morning_ on _Codes And Keys_ and the result is almost as good.

Elsewhere, the remaining tracks are polite but lack any real bite. In some reviews, much was made of the synth sounds employed on the new material but to my ears it does not sound any more advanced than 2005’s _Plans_, an album which had songs that were far more emotionally astute than those featured here. Meanwhile, nothing on _Plans_, _Narrow Stairs_ or the current album sounds like anything on _Give Up_, the sole album that singer Ben Gibbard recorded as part of **The Postal Service**. It is a shame that Death Cab have fallen back a bit in their songwriting and it remains to be seen whether they can pull up from the current nose-diving career trajectory that comfort, appearances in soft focus songtages and stadium sized gigs has led them into.

Meanwhile, **Battles** are another band softening their edges on their second full album _Gloss Drop_. Having lost uber-experimentalist and focal point Toyandai Braxton, you might think that the band might become overly indulgent and dull. While the energy expenditure is a bit more economic than on _Mirrored_, I think that although there’s nothing to match _Atlas_ this is a very fine album indeed. For me, _Mirrored_ was often a little too angular for its own good and the transcendant moments like the aforementioned _Atlas_ stood out simply because rhythms were allowed to build and then soar away.

A softly softly approach to the fiddly motorik polyrhythms that Battles are so fond yields great dividends, producing an album you can march along to or sit down and really lose yourself inside of. Even if there aren’t quite as many breathtaking moments here as on _Mirrored_, it is much more fun and the guest spots are well-posistioned to provide embellishments to the sound. Of the four additional contributors, I’d only heard of Matias Aguayo and Gary Numan.

Matias Aguayo’s contribution is to _Ice Cream_, which is very much in his style of minimal electronic music based around samples of the human voice. What is so successful about the track is that it could sit quite comfortably on either _Mirrored_ or Aguayo’s own masterpiece of last year _Ay Ay Ay_. When two collaborators manage to capture both of their signature sounds when working together, you know that it’s a worthwhile collaboration.

I’d suspect that Gary Numan’s is a little more phoned in on _My Machines_ especially given that I hardly noticed the track at all on the first few listens. A few more run throughs though and sure enough, there he was warbling away and giving the impression that have been there in his car for a day or two. The other two collabs are also pretty subtle: this is because they are vocal contributions and much of what is thrilling about Battles’ music is the tightness and complete mastery of the rhythm section.

Moving on to that catch up albums now and the first of these is _These Re-imagined Machines_, a collection of remixes of tracks from the album _These Hopeful Machines_, which was released about a year ago. While these remixes do not add much more to the original tracks, which were also long and progressive, they do dial up the beats and get moving a lot quicker than the originals, which often got lost in a morass of found sound and quiet moments. Interestingly enough there is yet another version of the album, _These Humble Machines_, which consists of the original album edited back to a single CD (the original is 12 tracks spanning two discs). I’ve yet to find a suitably priced download of this yet but if I do, it is certainly something that I will investigate.

Meanwhile, the remixes have driven me back to both the original album and to the rest of BT’s back catalogue as I have quite a lot of it in my collection. You’ll recall that [I included _Poseidon_ in a recent mixtape](2010/10/playlist-2-dancing-in-space/) and the other day I had a great time listening to both _Flaming June_ (while I had the chance!) and _Nectar_ off _ESCM_. I also listened to the whole of _Emotional Technology_ while debugging some code at work the other day and it was much better than I remembered. Nevertheless,  _Movement In Still-Life_ remains my favourite of his albums for now.

Finally, we have _Wounded Rhymes_ by **Lykke Li**, which I have been after ever since I caught her on Later With Jools Holland alongside [**PJ Harvey**](/2011/02/album-digest-february-2011/) and **Ed Sheeran**[^1]. I really like this album because it satisfies at least two of my major criteria: it’s short and it has attitude. I’m loathe to tease out a whole load of comparisons because there’s so many that I could make that it starts to feel redundant to do so. Here she sounds like Marina Topley-Bird, there she sounds like Nina from the Cardigans (yes, that is lazy swede-on-swede comparison at work) and elsewhere she sounds like the most amazing torch singer.

The songs themselves rock from side to side, all bluster and dynamism one minute (_Youth Knows No Pain_, _Get Some_), then insistent introspection (_I Follow Rivers_, _Sadness Is A Blessing_) and on to outright emoting (_Love Out Of Lust_, _I Know Places_). All the while the rhythm section (when required) is tight and together, making everything sound like the work of a band rather than that of a bunch of session musicians surrounding a solo artist. Meanwhile, no song overstays its welcome - even the six minute _I Know Places_  actually finishes in four and plays out with a gentle ambient coda. This makes for an intense and varied forty minutes that makes me want to put it on over and over again. I rarely ask for more than that.

[^1]: Much like KT Tunstall’s appearance on _Later…_, Ed Sheeran’s appears to have been a real breakout performance. I really like the song he performed, _The A-team_, but I really did not expect it to break out in the way that it has. Perhaps an indicator that people do still have taste after all?
