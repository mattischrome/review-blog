What’s your favourite number?

I was ambivalent on this issue until a few months ago until I came across the following quirky result: if you start with the prime number 41 and then add 2 you get 43, which is also prime and then if you add 4 to 43, you get 47: also prime. [And this continues to produce prime numbers if you add successive multiples of two to your running total](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=evaluate+x^2%E2%88%92x%2B41+for+x+from+0..40), UNTIL… you get to the 41st number in this sequence, which is 41 squared.

Now there is actually nothing magical about this, it’s just a freak result that probably arises from both the appeal to the human eye for this kind of neatness and the fact that [there are infinitely many prime numbers](http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/susan/cyc/p/primeprf.htm).

Anyway, 41 was the answer that I gave to Alex Bellos’s survey to find out people’s favourite numbers. If you want to participate, [you can do so here](http://www.favouritenumber.net/). Alex [explains his motivation on his blog](http://alexbellos.com/?p=1559).
