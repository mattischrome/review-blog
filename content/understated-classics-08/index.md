In the [understated classics](understated-classics) series, I try to alternate between pop/rock and electronic albums. Keeping with this trend number eight is the wonderful dub-infused album _Second Light_ by [Dreadzone](http://www.dreadzone.com). Released in 1996 it was well-received critically and four of its tracks featured on [John Peel](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/)'s best-of-year list that year. _Little Britain_ received a lot of radio play, a popular choice for that flag-waving period of [britpop](http://www.mojo4music.com/13834/the-story-of-britpop-in-60-albums/) and assorted other demons.

The strengths of _Second Light_ as an album is the anglicana[^1] of its first half and the subversion of it in the second half. I often talk of how albums are front-loaded with the best tracks to get you immersed in them. This is probably a hangover from vinyl where you could repeatedly play one side, making it necessary to make cohesive 'sides' of music.

Despite having two distinct sides _Second Light_ is a coherent album. It starts with the gentle dub rumbler _Life, Love & Unity_. The first sample you hear sets the tone: it’s from _[Monty Python & The Holy Grail](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/monty_python_and_the_holy_grail/)_[^2]. There’s a lovely wash of it and other samples (“The family that prays together, stays together”) as the track gets under way. This signifies the Englishness and cheekiness of what is to follow, while at the same time introducing a rumbling dub reggae beat. The album is filigreed with interesting samples and dialogue[^3] akin to the best work of The Orb[^4]. There aren’t many lyrical passages from the band itself, especially compared to later albums, there’s no more on the album until _Zion Youth_ over halfway in.

Next comes a wonderful trilogy of (mostly) instrumental tracks _Little Britain_, _A Canterbury Tale_, and _Captain Dread_. The first and the third of these use pastoral riffs and [reels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reel_(dance)) to produce energetic dance music that intersects neatly with the folk heritage it seeks to appropriate. _A Canterbury Tale_ acts as a beautiful interlude between the two more upbeat tracks. It evolves slowly in a shimmer of sunshine and gorgeous choral vocals that may or may not be sampled from a more famous classical piece. It is probably my favourite track on the album.

The main feature of Dreadzone's music is the dub reggae sound and obviously that does not feature as much on _Little Britain_, _A Canterbury Tale_, and _Captain Dread_. We start to go deeper into dub in the next few tracks. The bassline of _Captain Dread_ gives out into the burbling atmospherics of _Cave Of Angels_, using some unknown movie dialogue ("In the cave we must be very careful not to offend the gods") and a vocal sample that drives us underground toward subterranean levels of bass. As such we get closer to the dub sound but maintain the connection to England, in the form of a vision question to a mystic [Arthurian Albion](http://www.greatmystery.org/GMEmail/albionarthur.html) - home of [Excalibur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excalibur) and [the Holy Grail](http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/features/mythical/grail.html).

Then from _Zion Youth_ onward, anything goes. If by 'anything' you mean dub-centric house tunes. It has catchy vocals, actually the only other proper vocals by members of the group on the album after _Life, Love & Unity_. _Zion Youth_ was also released as a single and there is a cracking [Underworld](http://www.underworldlive.com) remix about. It is one of the mixes in which [Darren Emerson](https://soundcloud.com/darren-emerson) had more input; it dispenses with the reggae lilt and replaces it with some steely [progressive house](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=progressive%20house). There are enough references to the original to make it work brilliantly[^5].

For me, the second best track on the album is _One Way_ and it is almost the opposite of _A Canterbury Tale_. It's still pretty laid back but is much more fluid and dispenses with vocal samples altogether. Meanwhile, a wonderful bass line lopes up along with what sound like [303s](http://www.vintagesynth.com/roland/303.php), and it builds into something that you can't help but dance to. I fear for my neighbours each time that I have it on.

_Shining Path_ revisits the _Cave Of Angels_ territory, another laid back eastern-influenced track with chimes and flutes. It’s pinned together with what sounds like samples from a self-hypnosis tape. It is the track I was listening to when I took a picture of the sun while walking home from work - one of those moments where the music you are listening to and the world around you combine to produce a transcendent moment.

To close the album, _Out Of Heaven_ surfs down on a piano riff and a gentle bassline brings everything back to earth. The bass gets more strident in the middle but the track is all downtempo. Delicate female vocals and male choirs echo around, synths burble, and slowed down disco strings strut their stuff. A disembodied voice occasionally repeats "Maybe I was lucky that way". It's beautiful and makes me think of what it must be like walking along the sea shore staring at the full moon on a balmy summer night. 


This fantastic album proves a number of things. First, John Peel really knew his stuff. Second, if there is such a thing as a 'difficult second album' ([I have discussed this before](uc5)) then this is one of those exceptions that proves the rule. Third, it is possible to make a dance album with long tracks that doesn’t feel like a grueling experience.

To my mind, Dreadzone never again made as complete an album as this one. There have been some stand-out tracks though: _Earth Angel_ from their next album _Biological Radio_ and _American Dread_ from their most recent album _Eye On The Horizon_ spring to mind.

[^1]: Think of 'Americana' but English, anything that evokes bowling greens, radiant sunshine, birdsong and church spires. Though if you google it, you’ll find that Anglicana is the spanish word for Anglican.
[^2]: The chorus of "Hello!" from the girls that torment Sir Galahad the Pure while he is held prisoner at Castle Anthrax.
[^3]: Unfortunately, the use of interesting dialogue and sound effects in electronic music is decreasing. This is mostly due to clearance issues and large media companies attempting using cleared samples as a new form of income. (In realistic language, the owners of samples are money grabbing gits!)
[^4]: Those of you who know me personally may be wondering why there is no album by The Orb in this series. Please be assured that one is coming. The difficulty is deciding which album to choose and then whether it was suitably understated for this series. In the end, the resulting article may be a bit [UC6 and The Shamen](/uc6/), where I also wote more generally about the rest of their back catalogue as well the album in question. 
[^5]: As another spoiler for things to come, search youtube for the Underworld mix of _Zion Youth_ and then compare it to the _Carp dreams… Koi_ remix of their own track _Pearl's Girl_.
