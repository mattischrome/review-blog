Not being much of a drinker, I've never felt the need to do [dry January](https://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/alcohol/Pages/dry-january-helped-me-take-back-control-of-my-drinking.aspx). Also Ingrid and I sat in a restaurant in [Barcelona](https://mattischrome.com/spain-new-year-201718/) on January 2nd drinking for the third night in row. We hadn't got off to that great a start. Well today marks the completion of a dry month: dry January with a two day lag.

I also (mostly) managed to keep to my other goal of [eliminating sugar](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/16/case-against-sugar-sweetness-and-blight-rachel-cooke) from my tea and coffee. This meant I cut out at least three teaspoons of sugar a day for a month. I can't say it was easy. For a while I compensated by hoovering up the post-Christmas chocolates. Then came a period of the blues, though that was probably just [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias). They don't call the third Monday of January ["blue Monday"](https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/blog/truth-about-blue-monday) for nothing.

But after a few weeks I found myself enjoying cups of tea and coffee without sugar. My mood improved, which had nothing to do with a couple of sunny days and/or the release of [new Civ VI DLC](https://civilization.com/news/entries/civilization-vi-gitarja-leads-indonesia/)[^1]. Now I am looking for the next small modification I can make. I think it has to be related to sleep. I am reading ["Why We Sleep" by Matthew Walker](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/295665/why-we-sleep/) and every sentence feels like a denouncement of my current habits. I'm a terrible sleeper and I need to get better at that. Perhaps one for when the post-Australia jetlag is over?

[^1]: All the DLC comes out for Macs much later than on PC and at unspecified times. It's the gaming equivalent of "Waiting for Godot".
