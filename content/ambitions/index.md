Sometimes, when I am feeling a bit down, I like to write down some of my ambitions. As you can see from this list they are mostly pretty humble but they are also a bit cheesy and embarassing, so I have put them after the fold!

* Be wholehearted, cheerful, and sincere
* Be creative
* Look at the world and see its many faces, hear its many voices
* Explore new recipes as often as possible when I cook
* Learn to like the taste of tomatoes and cucumbers
* Be more at ease around people
* Listen to people and hear what they say
* Play my part
* Look after someone special
* Become a parent
* Share my values with others, help those who need it
* Break up all the negative things inside me
* Know what other people want, help them get it
* When I wake up each morning I would like to remember my dreams
* Understand art more than I do
* Lose my fear of creepy crawlies
* Learn to drive
* Learn to write left handed (why not?)
* Visit every country in Europe
* Visit the radio telescopes on Mauna Kea in Hawaii
* Let go of unnecessary things
* Ditch social networks and the rest of the internet as much as possible
* Learn to appreciate the noise around me
* Meditate
* Get over my reliance on sugar to improve my mood
* Get rid of things I donâ€™t need
* Grow the garden
* Write people letters
* Learn the differences between species of trees
* Be flexible and adaptable and positive about the future
* Learn how to hang a picture on a wall
