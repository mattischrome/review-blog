## Background

_Tiger Bay_ is Saint Etienne's third album and I think it is among their best. It was released in June 1994 on Heavenly records. I first owned a copy in 1998 when I picked it up while living in halls as an undergraduate. The reason for including this album in the understated classics series is the same as for [_Second Light_](uc8) by Dreadzone: it marries traditional forms to newer electronic music[^1]. _Second Light_ melds classical music and sea shanties to house and dub reggae to evoke the rolling hills and mystic caves of England. _Tiger Bay_ grafts folk structures on to Balearic pop songs and electronic experiments in order to visit motorway verges, windswept seashores, and Mediterranean holidays. There is even a ghost story (_Boy Scouts of America_) for good measure.

## Overture

The album opens sprightly with _Urban Clearaway_, an instrumental that evokes a drive out along the motorway into the countryside. A motorik beat underpins to give it that road trip vibe. String pads weave outwards as the track concludes making it into a pretty little journey of a song. You could describe it as "Neu! on the M25", but that would hide just how cinematic and velvety the string arrangement is. If Kraftwerk and Neu! were good at showing us the aesthetics and the kinetics of the autobahn, Saint Etienne reproduce it together with the expectation and excitement of travelling to somewhere new.

## Songs and singles, instrumentals and demos

The next track _Former Lover_ is a wonderfully wistful song that plays out over a lush folksy acoustic guitar motif, which makes an obvious contrast to the next track _Hug My Soul_. Throughout the of the album there is a clear distinction between songs written by Bob Stanley and Ian Wiggs2, and those written by Sarah Cracknell and her collaborators3.

The first two singles off the album were _Hug My Soul_ and _Pale Movie_. These are among two of the finest pop songs that Saint Etienne ever produced. It is a shame that Bob Stanley is a bit snooty about them in the liner notes of the recent reissue. In particular he did not like how _Pale Movie_ was chosen as the first single over _Like A Motorway_. _Like A Motorway_ is a fine song, with some cracking remixes4, and it may have been better at tempting to listeners to the album than a throwaway pop song. In some ways the band are a victim of their own considerable production skills as the demo of _Pale Movie_ included in the reissue is more in keeping with the rest of _Tiger Bay_. At the same time it also manages to sound a bit like _Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood_ by Santa Esmerelda. Dig out the soundtrack to _Kill Bill vol. 1_ to see what I mean.

_On The Shore_ has some burbling synth and a superb windswept vocal from Shara Nelson. It also has perhaps the most annoying frog-like sound on a record before _The Crazy Frog_5, a sort of mechanised ribbit that repeats throughout the track. I would dearly love to hear a version of this track without that noise. Perhaps there is a frog-free demo somewhere? Talking of demos, four are included with the reissue. These are _Western Wind_, _Hug My Soul_, _Pale Movie_, and _Urban Clearaway_. It’s a nice selection from the album's broad pallete of styles. Most of the demos are darker and more forceful. If this is also the case with early versions of _On The Shore_ then its demo would be worth a listen even if the frog noise is still there.

## The spooky suite

The last three tracks form a suite of superb spooky tunes. It starts with _Cool Kids Of Death_, a skanking instrumental that is quite sinister, particularly in the Underworld remix that features on _Casino Classics_. I like the repeated melodica figure, the dub bass, the snares, and the keyboard stabs throughout: pretty much all of it really. I like the fact that something this simple can get you up and moving and yet still fit into the overall tone of the album.

On the reissue, three tracks have been fused into one - the instrumental _Tankerville_, bookended by two versions of the folk song _Western Wind_. One version is sung by Sarah Cracknell and the other by guest vocalist Stephen Duffy. In between, Tankerville uses the same mixture of beats, guitar and strings that works so well throughout the rest of the album to create a soundcape. Judging by the fact that the demo of _Western Wind_ is four minutes long and features some interesting _Tankerville_-esque sonics in the middle, it is likely that the whole ensemble originally came together like that. What I like is how right at the centre of it, as the strings and the synths burble away, you get completely lost in the mental pictures that the music creates. In this way, the instrumentals on _Tiger Bay_ are like [other music](/2010/09/understated-classics-4/) that I have [covered before](uc6) in [these posts](understated-classics).

Finally, we reach _Boy Scouts Of America_. I said earlier that it was a ghost story. I am not totally sure that this is true but it is indeed spooky. It is one of those wonderfully open-ended story-songs that [in three verses and twenty-four lines](http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107858692814/) manages to tell a story that would take a film much longer to navigate. From the opening line ("Like a birthday card from a previous year") to the last ("The Boy Scouts of America taught him all that he knows"), the characters are amorphous and their roles are uncertain. Why is the man guarding the woman? Why does she hug the sheets? What is the hidden heartache that causes the man's veil of coolness to slip? There are so many questions and yet the song just shifts into focus and out again without overstaying its welcome. After just three minutes the strings fade into the noises of passing trains.

## Beyond Tiger Bay

Saint Etienne are among my favourite bands. I think the blend of great pop songs, great stories and great arrangements lead me back to them time and time again. Whether it is the crazy nonlinear stories inside of nine-minute dance tracks like _How We Used To Live_ (from _Sound Of Water_) or the wonderful slice-of-life duet _Relocate_ (from _Tales From Turnpike House_), there is always plenty to enjoy. However, when it comes to a whole album experience, whether by Saint Etienne or by anyone else, you can't beat _Tiger Bay_.

[^1]: I use relative terms here, dance music is very new compared to the folk music that is referenced throughout _Tiger Bay_ (and _Second Light_). However electronic music is not really new. It has infiltrated popular music for over thirty years, so why do I keep doing referring to it as new?!
[^2]: _Former Lover_, _Like A Motorway_, _Marble Lions_ and _The Boy Scouts of America_.
[^3]: _Hug My Soul_ and _Pale Movie_.
[^4]: Two of these remixes, one by The Chemical Brothers and one by David Holmes, can be found on the excellent Casino Classics compilation. This rather wonderful two disc set has been criminally neglected in the reissue series in my opinion. That said, I picked up a copy secondhand for a decent price on amazon marketplace.
[^5]: Actually, The Crazy Frog single has no frog noises on it all, merely a cartoon frog in the video, making those in “On The Shore” the most annoying frog-like sounds on a record since time began.
