# mattischrome.com - Matthew Dorey's review blog

This is the repo that Netlify builds into mattischrome.com - my blog of book, film and music reviews (alongside a number of posts on many other topics).

If you want to build a site that looks like it, use **Gatsby Theme Amsterdam**:

- [Theme Documentation](https://github.com/ryanwiemer/gatsby-theme-amsterdam)
- [Theme Website](https://amsterdam.netlify.com/)
- [Demo](https://gatsby-starter-amsterdam.netlify.com/)

It's really easy to get started - though be warned that you will need to keep an eye on your images. This site barely builds at the moment and that's even after reducing the quality of images a great deal (many apologies to anyone viewing the site on a 4K screen!).
